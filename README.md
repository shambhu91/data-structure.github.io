## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

c++,c, handling JSON file

- - - -

### procedure to run the program

1. Save the code in c++ and the input file friendlist.json in a same location.
2. Now, compile the code(using cmd : g++ file_name.cpp) and run it(using cmd : ./a.out /home/gfg/friendlist.json) with passing file name friendlist.json along with proper location(e.g. /home/gfg/friendlist.json).
3. A file named answers.json will be created on the same location where code and friendlist.json file is existing.
